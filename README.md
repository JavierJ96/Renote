# Renote

Renote is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others.


## Development

Renote is my first website that I've ever coded. From wireframes, to mock-ups, a homepage and a dashboard. It took some time and I had my fustrations, by trying to make the site responsive. I did a number of commits, trying to test the site on different devices rather than my own. I used Chrome Inspect, which was a big help on it's own. I'll admit the HTML and CSS code isn't that great in terms of organization, and that probably add to my frustations. Overall Renote has slight issues, though it came out well considering this was my first time coding a website. 


## Built With
